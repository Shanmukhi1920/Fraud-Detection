# Methodology
1. **Data Collection**
   - Sourced from Kaggle; covers transactions from 1000 customers and 800 businesses between January 2019 and December 2020.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Cleaned to remove missing values and duplicates.
   - Engineered features like transaction distances, time-related attributes, and simplified analysis by segmenting states into regions (Northeast, Midwest, South, West) and consolidated numerous job titles into broader categories.
     
3. **Feature Selection and Normalization**
   - Excluded non-predictive information and normalized numerical features to ensure model compatibility and effectiveness.

4. **Dataset Balancing**
   - Employed Random Under Sampling to address class imbalance in the large dataset, creating a balanced distribution for the modeling process.

5. **Modeling and Evaluation**
   - Tested various models (e.g., Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Multi-Layer Perceptron), emphasizing recall to optimally detect fraud.
   - Evaluated models based on precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy.

6. **Feature Importance**
   - Conducted post-modeling analysis to identify and interpret the most influential features in fraud prediction, highlighting the significance of transaction amount, transaction time, and specific categories like high-value internet and POS transactions.

# Installation and Usage
